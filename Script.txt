Introduction

"Your friend is entering the Michigan Tech Esports team and needs a computer that he can rely on to help him win the tournament. 
However, both of you are poor college students and do not have the funds to pay for this gaming computer. 
Instead of saving up and potentially not participating this year, you decide to steal parts from a local supplier. 
You must steal the best possible parts from the supplier and not get caught in the process.
Good luck!"
